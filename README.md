Gatekeeper: An Authentication & Authorization Library
==========

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/psecio/gatekeeper.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/psecio/gatekeeper)

The Gatekeeper library is a simple drop-in library that can be used to manage users, permissions and groups for your application. The goal is to make securing your application as simple as possible while still providing a solid and secure foundation to base your user system around.

Gatekeeper is best classified as a Role-Base Access Control (RBAC) system with users, groups and permissions. It is framework-agnostic and is set up to use its own database for the user handling.

**More Information:** For more information on the library, please see [the official project documentation](http://gatekeeper-auth.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
